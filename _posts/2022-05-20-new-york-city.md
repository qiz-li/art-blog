I have always admired New York City, the people, the culture, but particularly the architecture: modern skyscrapers side by side with historical landmarks. I tried to capture that with this drawing. I focused a lot on the details and spent quite some time on it. It took multiple sittings to finish, but I enjoy the final piece.

The overall composition is good, and although it is not perfect, it has a distinct style. Drawing the intricacies of buildings and architecture was one of my original motivations to get more familiar with pen drawing, and I am glad I accomplished that with this piece. I hope to visit New York one day (incoming Fall 2023!).
