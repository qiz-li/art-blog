<h1>About</h1>

<h2>Bio</h2>

Nathan Li is an aspiring artist living in the Geater Vancouver area. At school, he is currently enrolled in the elite art program, where he continues to explore a variety of mediums. His works fuse together his deep interests in art, technology, and design. He is fascinated by the design of mundane objects in everyday life and the intensely practical and applicable value of art. However, he is also drawn to art as an abstract faucet for expression and creativity. He loves art.

<h2>Artist Statement</h2>

<p>I make art for myself. I believe art is a deeply subjective experience. Therefore, the true value of art to <i>me</i> is how much <i>I</i> enjoy it. My work is unapologetic and, one could even say, selfish. However, that is not to alienate my audience. I am constantly influenced and inspired by great artists, teachers, and feedback I receive. Art is an extension of me. I don't hesitate to express my opinions, values, and experiences, and I don't create to please others if it does not also please me.</p>
