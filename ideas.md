A peak into my sketchbook and the spontaneous ideas within it and beyond! (In chronological order.)

## Artificial Rock #143

_2023-04-10 · Waterfront, Vancouver, British Columbia_

Visited beautiful sculpture by Chinese artist Zhan Wang. On display outside 200 Granville St as part of the Vancouver Biennale, representing traditional Chinese 假山石 (jia shan shi) that is often placed in gardens and courtyards to resemble natural scenery.

## Brilliant Signage

_2023-03-23 · Cambridge, Massachusetts_

Despite the slow and sluggish performance of the Boston subway system (The "**T**"), this sign at Alewife station was among the coolest I've seen—clearly showing the location and type of the exists through a 3D perspective (even featuring a basketball court and a train as scale!).

## Terrible UX

_2023-03-21 · Morrisburg, Ontario_

Stopped at an ONroute rest stop on the way to Montreal. The only way to order food was through an automatic order machine that had a terrible user interface (there are two options for each size?). What may have been a five-second ordeal with the cashier turned into a 15-minute struggle with the machine (featuring hard taps and frustrated sighs).

Moreover, less than 100 km from Quebec, the menu was only available in English. Later, I witnessed firsthand an older French-speaking couple struggle to order food.

Moral of the story: if humans can do it better, let them do it, please. Plenty of time in the future for machines to replace us.
